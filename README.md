This data mini-project attempts to answer the predictive question of:

> ### *How do I find the sun terraces in Berlin?*

Inspirational tagline:

> ### *Meet me on my ter{1,2}a(c|s){1,2}e?*

**Motivation:**<br>
1. Demonstrate beginning data science and Python coding skills as my "evidence of technical training" upload for my application to the Hertie School's Master of Data Science for Public Policy program. My learning path was largely informed by chapters three and four of "Data Science: Concepts and Practice" by Vijay Kotu and Bala Deshpande ([amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Predictive-Analytics-Data-Mining-Concepts/dp/012814761X), [official](http://www.introdatascience.com/)), materials found in Huy Ngoc Dang's [repository](https://github.com/huydang90/Hertie-School-Data-Science-Society) for the Hertie School Data Science Society, and the data science core skils learning path on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/data-science-python-core-skills/). Also, a very honorable mention to [Jason Brownlee PhD](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) for his articles and reference code provided to explain important machine learning concepts.
2. Learn a bit about neighborhoods (or at least districts in this iteration) in [Berlin](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/neighbourhoods-berlin) and have some fun browsing nice photos of terraces on Airbnb.com. This was inspired after hearing about the attractive idea of renting apartments with "sun terraces" in Berlin during a Hertie School information session which seemed possible but not entirely common. Perhaps this could be a simple, not too profound, exercise for learning more about predictive algorithms using a real-world dataset?
